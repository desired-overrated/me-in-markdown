## Introduction

Helllo! My name is Bella Moon. I am currently in 10th grade and I am on the JV volleyball team. A book I am in the rpocess of reading is powerless and I'm reading it because of a lot of my friends have recommended it to me. A personal achivement of mine is geting a 4.0 in all of middle school and 9th grade.

This summer I went to Vegas with my family and Vegas is know for their strong winds. Taking that in, we had a dust storm as we were swimming. It was a first for me and it was a big shock. Furthermore, in this class, I hope to further my knowledge of coding and how it is used in everyday life. 

Moving on, volleyball has been a big passion for me since I was little. Making the JV team was such a blessing to me. I hope that I can make varisty by my junior or senior year. It is so much fun to me because most of my close friends are also in the volleyball program. I aspire to get better at volleyball in terms of skill.
